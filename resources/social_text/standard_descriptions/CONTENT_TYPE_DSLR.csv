⏳This is a “motion interpolated” timelapse, generated from still DSLR images taken at regular intervals during the session. This results in a smoother video, being 60fps rather than ~5fps, but it leads to interesting artefacts and a ghostly aesthetic.	⏳This is a “motion interpolated” timelapse, generated from still DSLR images taken at regular intervals during the session.

The emulsifier (dish soap) changes the surface tension and interacts with the fats in the milk, causing incredible patterns to emerge."
